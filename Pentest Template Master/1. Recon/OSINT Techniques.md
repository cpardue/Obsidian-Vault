**GAP ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY** 
Gap analysis takes stock of the initial information that you have and then applies four simple questions to identify what to do next. This can be applied to bring structure and order to your OSINT research. 
The four questions are: 
1) What do I know? 
2) What does this mean? 
3) (So) What do I need to know? 
4) How do I find out?
