Weaknesses



LLM08:2025 Vector and Embedding Weaknesses THREATS
Vector and Embedding Weaknesses refers to security vulnerabilities in
Large Language Models (LLMs) that arise from improper handling of vector
embeddings—numerical representations of data—which can lead to
unauthorized data access, data poisoning, or unintended model behaviors.
