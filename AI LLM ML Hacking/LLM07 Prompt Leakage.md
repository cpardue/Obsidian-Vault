LLM07:2025 System Prompt Leakage - THREATS
System Prompt Leakage refers to the risk that system prompts—internal
instructions guiding the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs)—may
inadvertently contain sensitive information, such as credentials or internal
rules, which, if exposed, can be exploited by attackers to compromise the
system's security.

Leak of System Prompt / Developer instructions
Trick LLM with encoding / language to leak prompt
Sometimes API keys present in prompt
Sometimes hidden API endpoints hardcoded in prompt
Can contain embarrassing directives for the organization
Helps attacker to understand the LLM inputs much better

•

Prompt Isolation & Segmentation
(Separate system prompts from user inputs)
Output Filtering & Redaction
(block unintended system prompt exposure)
Access Controls & Role-Based Restrictions
(Restrict who can modify system prompts)
Context-Aware Query Analysis
(monitor for adversarial probing techniques)
Differential Privacy & Prompt Encryption
(encrypt sensitive prompt component, no sensitive data in prompt)
