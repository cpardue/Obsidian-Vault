What is AI and Language Models?
Definition of AI:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is technology that enables machines to mimic human intelligence,
performing tasks such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.
Introduction to Language Models:
Language models are a type of AI that understand, interpret, and generate human language.
They can write text, answer questions, and even create stories.



AI / LLM Introduction
What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?
Definition:
LLMs are advanced language models trained on vast amounts of text data.
They can comprehend and produce text in a way that feels incredibly human-like.
Key Features:
Their ability to understand context, generate coherent and diverse text, and learn from a wide range
of topics.



AI / LLM Introduction
The Learning Process of LLMs
Training Process:
LLMs are trained using examples from a massive dataset of text, learning patterns, grammar, and
information about the world.
Machine Learning Techniques:
Use of algorithms and statistical methods to improve their understanding over time.



AI / LLM Introduction
Applications of LLMs
Diverse Applications:
Chatbots, writing assistance, content creation, and language translation.
Impact:
LLMs are transforming industries by automating writing tasks, providing customer support, and
enhancing communication.



AI / LLM Introduction
The Future of LLMs and Challenges Ahead
Advancements:
Potential future improvements in LLM technology, like better understanding and more personalized
interactions.
Ethical and Technical Challenges:
Issues such as bias, privacy, and the need for responsible usage.



AI / LLM Introduction
The AI Development Cycle
1. Problem Identification:
Define the problem you want the AI to solve.
2. Data Collection:
Gather and prepare data relevant to the problem.
3. Model Design:
Choose the AI model that best fits the problem's requirements.
4. Training:
Feed the data into the model to teach it how to solve the problem.

The AI Development Cycle (cont.)
5. Evaluation:
Test the model to see how well it performs and identify areas for improvement.
6. Deployment:
Implement the AI solution in a real-world application.
7. Monitoring and Maintenance:
Continuously monitor the AI's performance and update it as needed to adapt to new data or
changing conditions.



AI / LLM Introduction
Tokenization
The process of converting text into smaller units (tokens) that a computer can understand.
Tokens can be words, characters, or subwords.
Preprocessing:
Text is cleaned and standardized (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation) to make tokenization
more effective.
Breaking Down Text:
The AI splits the text into tokens based on predefined rules or learned patterns. This can involve
splitting by spaces, punctuation, or using algorithms to identify subword units in languages.



AI / LLM Introduction
Tokenization (cont.)
Converting Tokens to Numbers:
Each token is assigned a unique number.
This numerical representation is what the AI model processes.
Training and Understanding:
The AI uses these numbers (tokens) to learn patterns, grammar, and meanings during training.
When processing new text, it uses this learned information to understand or generate text.
