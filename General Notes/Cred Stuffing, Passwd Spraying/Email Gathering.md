## Email gathering with hunter.io
### hunter.io
is a website, realistically used quite a bit
this is the first stop
1. sign in
2. dashboard
3. enter domain & search
4. lists findings and “Most common patter:”
Most common pattern for my target is output as {f}{last}@domain
Also listed job titles as found
Also lists source each email was pulled from
CAN EXPORT TO CSV!!!
This already looks extremely useful for osint!

## gathering breached creds with breach-parse
### Breach-parse
https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse
it's just a crappy script he made, requires downloading a 44GB data dump of breaches
can possibly use this
